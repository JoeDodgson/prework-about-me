      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>To whoever is reading this, hello, hola, ni hao, bonjour, ciao! I am Joey D, a Civil Engineer with a keen interest in software development. I'm excited to be taking my first big steps into a career in software development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Lichfield (north of Birmingham). Did you know Lichfield is the birthplace of Dr Samuel Johnson, the first person in the world to write a dictionary?</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>To keep fit I mainly do strength training at the gym, but I also love climbing (bouldering), diving, skiing, hiking, swimming. I'm a season ticket holder at Aston Villa (Holte End Upper - K6) and I go to a fair few away games. I also really enjoy playing board games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Doing something which challenges me and gets me thinking (I love the grind of solving problems) and which I enjoy. And doing something which has a positive impact on people.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live with my wife, Helen, in an apartment in Dickens Heath village (Solihull).</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Having worked in the civil engineering industry I have seen the value of automating repetitive and manual processes and I strive to make a career out of doing so. I have a logical mind and I am mathematically strong. The little amount of coding I have done was highly rewarding and I took to it quickly so I am looking to change my career into coding and software development.</p>
